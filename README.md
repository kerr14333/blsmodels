# BLS Stan Models

This repo consists of simulated data that we wish to apply our stan  models to. The jolts, samgen3 and reportlevel models and R programs were written by Julie Gershunskaya and Terrance Savitsky.

* **eight_schools** - Eight Schools example centered/non-centered parameterization. I include it because the centered parameterization had what looks like similar behavior to the samgen3 model. Maybe there is a connection? Maybe I am missing something? 
* **jolts** - JOLTS (Job Openings and Labor Turnover Survey - The survey you have been seeing in the news about the large number of people quitting their jobs) - Programs and simulated data in directory. 
* **reportlevel** - Our MRP model for Current Employment Statistics (CES) Survey Small Area Modelling using report level (microdata or sample unit) data. Contains programs and simulated data.
* **samgen3_toysim** - BLS CES samgen3 (Small Area Model Generation 3) model with simulated data.
