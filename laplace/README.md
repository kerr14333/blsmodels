# Report Level Model Using Laplace Approximation

This folder contains simulated report level data in the `data/` directory to run the version of the model using the laplace approximation. This data is simplified from earlier versions of the report level model.  The stan file is located at `model/y_mrp_simpleZ_laplace_042722.stan`. The R program `replevel.R` runs the model.
